                At Emerge, our main expectation is the practice of respectful communication. We expect group members to be respectful towards each other and group leaders. Group members who are not respectful will be asked to leave the group and may risk termination from the program. We also expect group members to respect each other’s confidentiality by not describing other group members outside of the group. Group members can speak to their friends and family about what they are learning and how they are working to change.
